# Working with tuples

# It is a kind of Data Structure. Tuples are immutable. Once defined cannot be changed or modified.

# The difference between List and Tuple is List is [] and Tuple is (). Also list is mutable while Tuple is immutable.

# We can also use Tuple and List together. An example is gven below

coordinates = (4, 5)  # Creation of a tuple
print(coordinates[0])


lituple = [(1, 2), (3, 4)]
print(lituple[1])
